# Neural Network Libraries - Examples

This repository contains working examples of [Neural Network Libraries](https://github.com/sony/nnabla/).
Before running any of the examples in this repository, you must install the Python package for Neural Network Libraries:

```
pip install -U nnabla
```

Installing the [CUDA extension](https://github.com/sony/nnabla-ext-cuda/) for Neural Network Libraries will allow you to run examples on a CUDA-compatible GPU:

```
pip install -U nnabla-ext-cuda
```

Before running an example, also run the following command inside the example directory, to install additional dependencies:

```
cd example_directory
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
